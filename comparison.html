              <h4>African Tax Administration Forum (ATAF)</h4>
              <p>The African Tax Administration Forum is a pan-African body headquartered in Pretoria, South Africa. ATAF provides an important, collective voice for African countries in regional and global platforms, and thereby contributes to, and influences, the international tax dialogue to the benefit of the African continent. Its approach mainly focuses on advocacy as well as the provision of capacity building and technical assistance across the region.</p>
<p>ATAF is supported by two TAI donor members – Hewlett Foundation and Open Society Foundations. This funding supports ATAF’s strategic plan which is focused on building more efficient and effective tax administrations in order to boost tax collection, reduce illicit financial flows, support inclusive development, eradicate fiscal corruption and enable participation by African countries in regional and global tax dialogues.</p>

              <p>The Global Alliance for Tax Justice is a global network organization with a decentralized secretariat. It is an alliance of 5 regional networks of Africa, Latin America, Asia-Australia, North America and Europe, which collectively represent hundreds of organisations in over 60 countries. It campaigns for multinationals to pay their fair share of tax, for a global tax body under the auspices of the UN, for gender and tax justice and for more progressive tax and fiscal policies. Its approach relies on advocacy and campaigning, as well as capacity building and citizen mobilization. GATJ works at global, regional and national levels.</p>
<p>GATJ is currently funded by Ford Foundation and Open Society Foundations. Ford Foundation provided an initial one-year grant in 2017 to help GATJ develop its long-term strategy and organizational vision. It is now providing support through 2018/19 for GATJ's advocacy and campaigning activities. Funding from Open Society Foundations for 2017-18 is enabling staff to increase priority work with members and allies to expand the reach and effectiveness of GATJ’s <em>‘Multinationals Pay Your Share!’</em> campaign, and for GATJ to develop greater capacity for long-term growth and sustainability.</p>

              <p>The International Budget Partnership is a network organization based in Washington D.C. It invests in citizen capacity to understand and analyse budgets, to participate in the budget process and to advocate for changes in budget policies that transform lives. It works to make governments more transparent, accountable and responsive to the needs and priorities of the people, especially the poor and marginalised. It works at global, national and sub-national levels and is involved in research, advocacy and capacity building and learning. </p>
<p>The IBP receives funding from three TAI donor members: Ford Foundation, Hewlett Foundation and Open Society Foundations. The three foundations provide general support to IBP’s work to make public finance systems worldwide more transparent, participatory and accountable. Core grants enable work in four interlinked areas combining civil society pressure at country level with pressure from international institutions for more responsive budgeting. The four areas are: Building organisations; Opening budgets; Establishing global norms; and Learning what works. IBP is in the process of developing its next strategic plan, to be completed in mid-2018, and will include an increased emphasis on promoting greater equity in country tax policies and administration. </p>

              <h4>Oxfam America</h4>
              <p>Oxfam America is an international anti-poverty NGO based in Boston with a large policy-advocacy office in Washington D.C. It aims to create lasting solutions to poverty, hunger and social injustice. It works with the Oxfam global confederation at global, regional and national levels, doing and supporting research, advocacy, campaigning, capacity building and citizen mobilization and participation programs.</p>
<p>Oxfam America, as well as other Oxfam affiliates, is supported by Ford Foundation, Hewlett Foundation and Open Society Foundations. From Ford Foundation it has received a grant over two years for general support for its global Accountable Development Finance program promoting transparency and citizen power in public finance and public resource decision-making. Tax work includes support for a corporate tax advisor and engagement with US corporations on their tax policies, including positions on public country by country reporting (CBCR) and use of tax havens. The program includes a focus on achieving public CBCR directly with companies, the adoption of public policies in the US and the EU, as well as supporting popular campaigns on tax justice issues in developing countries with a particular focus on extractives.</p>
<p>The Hewlett Foundation provides general support also to the Accountable Development Finance program. The grant supports country level work on improving tax collection and administration in the extractive industries, as well as global work related to improving strategies for domestic resource mobilization. The Hewlett Foundation also supports new work building bridges between fiscal justice / tax transparency groups and women’s groups related to extractives industry taxation and revenue use and "follow the money work" in West Africa and South Africa. Open Society Foundations supports the Accountable Development Finance program, focused on work at the country level on tax transparency and campaigning on tax justice issues related to extractives industries as well as Oxfam's global Commitment to Reducing Inequality Index which looks at country-level tax policies and how they impact inequality. </p>

              <p>Tax Justice Europe (TJ-E) is a network that aims for a world where transparency and fair tax policies counteract inequalities and generate the public funding needed to ensure human rights, including the rights of women, environmental protection and high quality public services for all. TJ-E is the European member of the Global Alliance for Tax Justice and works for transformative, yet specific changes to global and European policies, institutions, rules and structures. TJ-E works at global, regional and national levels. It is involved in research, advocacy, campaigning, capacity building and citizen mobilization efforts. Outreach to new actors is also a key element of TJ-E’s approach. Although the network already works closely with trade unions, it continues to cultivate relationships with new potential allies such as environmental groups, online movements and research organizations amongst others.</p>
<p>Open Society Foundations currently fund Eurodad to carry out the secretariat function of TJ-E. Their grant supports a project focused on reforming tax and transparency rules in Europe to prevent international tax dodging. The project includes network coordination, joint media work, research and reports, as well as some support for capacity development of campaigners in key countries.</p>

              <h4>Tax Justice Network-Africa (TJN-A)</h4>
              <p>Tax Justice Network Africa (TJN-A) is a pan-African organisation based in Kenya. It is a network of 29 members spanning 16 African countries. Its mission is to spearhead tax justice efforts in Africa by enabling citizens and institutions to advocate for equitable tax systems. Through its Nairobi Secretariat, TJN-A collaborates closely with its member organizations and other civil society partners across Africa. It focuses on both curbing illicit financial flows and promoting progressive taxation. TJN-A also plays a leading role in global coalitions committed to tackling the phenomena of global tax avoidance and evasion and achieving fundamental reforms of the current global financial architecture. It is a member of both the Global Alliance for Tax Justice and the Financial Transparency Coalition. Its approach includes policy research, advocacy and campaigning, as well as capacity building and citizen mobilization. TJN-A works at global, regional and national levels.</p>
<p>TJN-A is currently funded directly by Ford Foundation, Hewlett Foundation and Open Society Foundations, as well as indirectly from TAI donors via the Financial Transparency Coalition. Ford Foundation is providing core support to enable institutional strengthening. Hewlett Foundation is supporting TJN-A’s large capacity building programme including its annual Tax Justice Academy and its media training programme for investigative journalists across Africa. It also provides support to the secretariat's staffing and administration functions, to help build secretariat capacity to administer and support the network. Open Society Foundations support TJN-A in its work with 5 national level tax justice platforms: Uganda, Tanzania, Ghana, Nigeria and Zambia. This grant enables TJN-A to provide tailored support to members in these countries for their own network-building, policy, advocacy and campaigns activities. This work covers a variety of themes related to national taxation agendas including tackling harmful tax incentives, reforming extractives’ taxation and tax and investment issues including double taxation agreements.</p>
<p>Funding received from TAI via the Financial Transparency Coalition supports TJN-A’s work on tax transparency standards - including public beneficial ownership - as well as supporting TJN-A’s work on its broad illicit financial flows and international tax rules agenda. This support has been important in helping TJN-A participate effectively in global policy debates and forums in relation to achieving fairer tax rules and better global tax governance.</p>
