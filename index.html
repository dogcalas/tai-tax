This site is a resource for the members themselves, but hopefully also for other funders and organizations working on tax issues. You can explore the articulated pathways to improved tax outcomes for each core member and collectively, details of selected current grantees and funding, and how the work fits in a broader tax ecosystem. It is a complement to resources detailing bilateral and multilateral funding on tax, such as the <a href="http://drm.taxcompact.net/">DRM database.</a> </span></div>

    <p><strong>Tax – A Shared Priority of TAI Members</strong></p>
<p>TAI donor members are committed to supporting the development of a more equitable and inclusive tax governance system at the global and national levels. While tax governance is a newer area for the transparency and accountability community, growing concern over the low level of taxes paid by multinationals has increased the urgency around tax system reform for development. As calls to address tax avoidance and tax justice gain momentum around the world, TAI donors look to support efforts to increase tax transparency, end anonymous shell companies, and advocate for a more accountable and equitable global tax architecture.</p>
